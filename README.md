# Random Projects

## This repo contains several projects from different data science topics:
* [LSTM](LSTM-predicting_Apple_opening_stock_price.ipynb) - predicting Apple opening stock price- using LSTM to train the model on apple prices from feb 2nd 2017 to feb 2nd 2019, and predict the following 30 days.
* [Geographical Plots](Geographical_Plots.ipynb)- creating an interactive geographical map of the US that shows GDP per capita.
* [Gradient Descent with a simple equation](Gradient_Descent_simple_equation.ipynb)- a brief overview on how to use gradient descent to calculate the slope, intercept of an equation.
* [Hierarchical Clustering](Hierarchical_Clustering-Array_of_numbers_and_shopping_data.ipynb)- Array of numbers and shopping_data- using this clustering algorithm with a simple array of numbers, and later with a real dataset
* [K-Fold Cross-Validation](K-Fold-Cross-Validation-wineQualityReds.ipynb)- wineQualityReds - using K fold with the wine dataset
* [Linear Regression](Linear_Regression-student_scores-(hrs-studied-vs-score-on-exam).ipynb)- student_scores (hrs studied vs score on exam)- using linear regression to get the best fit line.
* [Mean Shift](Mean-Shift-Hierarchical-Clustering.ipynb)- Hierarchical Clustering- Fun with an array of nums- showing how mean shift is used with a simple array of nums. (3D visualization).
* [Multiple Linear Regression](Multiple-Linear-Regression-petrol_consumption.ipynb)- petrol_consumption- predicting petrol consumption with MLR.
* [Plotly Library for Interactive Data Visualization](Plotly-Library-for-Interactive-Data-Visualization.ipynb)- a brief intro to Plotly- bars/ plots/ etc.
* [Search Algorithms](Search-Algorithms.ipynb)- a brief into to several search algorithms with examples.
* [Useful Stuff](Useful-Stuff.ipynb)- a collection of useful data science tools used for feature engineering, data exploration, and more.
* [Web Scraping](Web-Scraping.ipynb)- a brief into to web scraping- I collected several quotes from a website and saved them in a file.
