# Random Projects

## This repo contains several projects from different data science topics:
* LSTM - predicting Apple opening stock price- using LSTM to train the model on apple prices from feb 2nd 2017 to feb 2nd 2019, and predict the following 30 days
* Geographical Plots- creating an interactive geographical map of the US that shows GDP per capita.
* Gradient Descent with a simple equation- a brief overview on how to use gradient descent to calculate the slope, intercept of an equation.
* Hierarchical Clustering- Array of numbers and shopping_data- using this clustering algorithm with a simple array of numbers, and later with a real dataset
* K-Fold Cross-Validation- wineQualityReds - using K fold with the wine dataset
* Linear Regression- student_scores (hrs studied vs score on exam)- using linear regression to get the best fit line
* Mean Shift- Hierarchical Clustering- Fun with an array of nums- showing how mean shift is used with a simple array of nums. (3D visualization)
* Multiple Linear Regression- petrol_consumption- predicting petrol consumption with MLR
* Plotly Library for Interactive Data Visualization- a brief intro to Plotly- bars/ plots/ etc.
* Search Algorithms- a brief into to several search algorithms with examples
* Useful Stuff- a collection of useful data science tools used for feature engineering, data exploration, and more
* Web Scraping- a brief into to web scraping- I collected several quotes from a website and saved them in a file
